This Python script utilizes OpenCV to perform real-time color detection based on predefined HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) ranges. It captures video from the default camera, processes each frame to extract the central pixel's HSV values, and identifies the predominant color by comparing these values with predefined color ranges. Detected colors include black, white, red, yellow, green, blue, and purple. The script displays the identified color prominently on the screen and updates in real-time as the camera feed changes.

Features:
-Uses OpenCV for video capture and color space manipulation.
-Implements predefined HSV ranges for accurate color detection.
-Supports real-time display of detected colors on video frames.

Instructions:
-Ensure OpenCV is installed (pip install opencv-python).
-Run the script and point the camera towards objects of different colors to see real-time color detection in action.
